## Technical Risks

| Risk ID | Risk Description                                          | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **T-01**  | **Poor Data Quality from Sources**                        | High       | High   | - **Multi-Source Verification**: Ingest data from multiple providers for the same metrics and cross-validate.<br>- **Automated Quality Gates**: Implement a robust data quality framework (Great Expectations) to automatically profile, test, and quarantine bad data at ingestion.<br>- **Red Team Philosophy**: Continuously run "adversarial torture tests" to ensure the platform is resilient to data corruption. |
| **T-02**  | **Platform Downtime or Performance Degradation**          | Medium     | High   | - **Hybrid Cloud Architecture**: Deploy critical, low-latency services on local Algerian servers and use a multi-AZ EU cloud region for high availability and failover.<br>- **Observability First**: Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing from day one to proactively identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.<br>- **SLA Commitment**: Establish and monitor a 99.9% uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA). |
| **T-03**  | **Data Breach or Cybersecurity Incident**                  | Medium     | High   | - **Defense-in-Depth Security**: Implement a multi-layered security architecture (WAF, RBAC, encryption at rest/in transit).<br>- **Regular Audits**: Conduct quarterly penetration tests and continuous vulnerability scanning.<br>- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and regularly test a formal incident response plan in accordance with Algerian law (72-hour notification).<br>- **Cyber Insurance**: Maintain a comprehensive cyber insurance policy. |
| **T-04**  | **Vendor or Technology Lock-in**                          | Medium     | Medium | - **Open-Source First**: Prioritize open-source technologies (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Spark, Iceberg) to maximize portability.<br>- **Multi-Cloud Abstraction**: Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) with provider-agnostic modules to facilitate potential migration.<br>- **Portable Data Formats**: Standardize on open data formats like Parquet to ensure data is not tied to a specific vendor's storage solution. |

| :------ | :--------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **B-01**  | **Slow User Adoption or Failure to Find Product-Market Fit** | High       | High   | - **Lean MVP Approach**: Launch a minimal, focused product within 3 months to test the core value proposition and gather market feedback.<br>- **Generous Free Tier**: Offer a compelling free tier to attract a large user base and drive word-of-mouth marketing.<br>- **Targeted Content Marketing**: Create high-value content (reports, blog posts) demonstrating the power of Algerian market data to attract and educate potential customers. |
| **B-02**  | **Bureaucratic Delays in Accessing Government Data**     | High       | Medium | - **Public-Private Partnership Strategy**: Build direct relationships with data stewards in key ministries and offer free data quality services to incentivize collaboration.<br>- **Multi-Source Redundancy**: Do not rely on a single source; have web scraping and crowdsourcing pipelines ready as fallbacks.<br>- **Focus on Non-Government Data**: Initially prioritize high-value datasets that can be acquired without government dependencies (e.g., e-commerce prices, real estate listings). |
| **B-03**  | **Regulatory Changes or Non-Compliance**             | Medium     | High   | - **Retain Local Legal Counsel**: Engage a legal expert specializing in Algerian data and technology law to ensure continuous compliance.<br>- **Flexible Architecture**: Design the platform to adapt to potential changes, especially regarding data localization and privacy rules.<br>- **Proactive Government Relations**: Engage with regulatory bodies to stay ahead of and potentially influence future data policy. |
| **B-04**  | **Competition from International Players**           | Medium     | Medium | - **Hyperlocal Moat**: Differentiate by providing Wilaya-level data and local dialect NLP that global competitors cannot replicate.<br>- **Latency Advantage**: Leverage the hybrid infrastructure to offer significantly lower latency for Algerian users.<br>- **Regulatory Compliance as a Feature**: Market full compliance with Algerian law as a key advantage for local enterprise and government customers. |
| **B-05**  | **Shortage of Skilled Data Professionals in Algeria**    | High       | High   | - **Remote Hiring & Diaspora Engagement**: Actively recruit from the Maghreb diaspora in Europe and North America.<br>- **Internal Training & Documentation**: Launch the "Algerian Data Academy" to build a local talent pipeline and maintain excellent internal documentation to reduce dependency on individuals.<br>- **Low-Code/No-Code Tools**: Implement self-service tools (e.g., dbt Cloud, Metabase) to empower less technical team members. |
